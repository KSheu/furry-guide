HW2 Report

1. Making sure I had the correct statements outputed per the specifications. 
Because of the metamorphosis of the spec, my primary problem was keeping up with all the changes, especially as things were updated on both Piazza and the course website. Since certain conditions required different "goodbye" outputs, and certain exceptions were added (such as too small a range) or taken away (such as inputting -1), my primary problem was developing a vision of what the program should perform. As soon as the specs were more stable (thanks to the students and prof.) the actual coding was not so difficult. There were still some things to figure out, however.

2. Seeding and outputing random numbers.
I ended up using srand() and seeded the random number generator with the current time to ensure that rand() would produce a different set of random numbers each time.

3. Finding a simple way to deal with slighly different game play for different levels.
I used switch to deal with multiple levels of game play. 

4. Figuring out the log functions.
I imported the libraries <cmath> to use log functions and ceil() to round up any calculated values.

5. Tracing the code by hand to sort out bugs such as repetitive code, incorrect counting.
I had problems were portions of code were repeated inside and outside while loops, causing the program to wait twice for user input. I solved this by tracing the code and eliminating repetitive code. Especially also for the switch statement, I remove code that was similar to both cases to be executed outside the declared cases.

6. Preventing the hint from printing if it is the last guess.
I used break to prevent the hint or try again statement from printing if the guess was on the last try.

7. Making sure the range of random numbers is correct.
I used the mod operator to produce the correct range of random numbers.
